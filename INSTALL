This file describes how to install tknotepad under windows 95/98 and under Linux:

It is assumed that Tcl 8.4 and tk8.4 or greater have been already installed on your system. These libraries are failry standard on most linux distributions (Fedora Core 8) 
   
You can obtain the Tcl/Tk libraries from http://www.tcl.tk. As the time of this writing they are free.

Read the installation of Tcl/Tk for your operating system, as that is beyond the scope of this document.


Line numbering:
---------------

patch name = INCLUDED in the base code as of 0.8.2

Originally I had no intention of including this in the base code, however
in tcl/tk 8.4 they now have unlimited undo/redo build into the base code.
As such I have been able to remove about 300 lines of code.  As a result of 
some of the changes in tcl/tk 8.4 I have been able to refactor the code base
and in about 700 lines I have been able to do the same as the previoud 900 
lines of code and add a few new features.  
It simple adds an entry to the bottom of the window, and puts the 
line number and column number in the widget. 

This also includes a modified message in the lower left corner
so that when the text is modified it will indicat that it is modified.

Goto to Line nunmber:
---------------------

patch name gotoline.pth

As of version 0.7.0 there has been added a patch that will add a goto line number menu option 
to the search menu. If this is to be applied with the line numbering patch it shoudl be added 
after the line numbering patch so that when you goto a line it will display the correct line
number. If this is going to be added without the line number patch then it just gets added to 
the end of the tknotepad script.


A popup menu:
-------------

patch name = INCLUDED in the base code as of 0.8.2

This patch is now completed but not working the way I expected. It is bound 
to both Button 2 and Button 3, and should be just Button 2. This is a 
tcl/tk X Windows issue thou.
It shows the Edit popup menu however, and works for me so I am happy with it.


New window:
---------------

patch name = newwin.pth

This patch adds a menu item to the File menu that will launch a new menu.
This patch may not work on Windows or Mac.

INSTALLING:

UNIX:
--------------

Installing the tarball under Linux (this should work for other UNIXes also but has not been tested)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) gunzip and untar the file I use the following command 

# tar -zxvf tknotepad-0.7.0.tar.gz 
	
2) There is now an install.sh script for unix. If you want ALL the patches and chances are
you do, then it will apply them all in the correct order.

Do 
    chmod 755 install.sh i

and then run it 

./install.sh

3) cd to the tknotepad-0.7.0 directory and make sure the permissons are set to 755, 
then copy tknotepad to /usr/local/bin/ or somewhere else that is in your path. 

#cp tkn+ /usr/local/bin/tknotepad

NOTE: You will need root access to copy to /usr/local/bin, if you do not have root 
access you can put in your home directory, and run it from there. 

4) You may need to make a symbolic link from your version of wish (i.e. wish8.0) to wish. 
You can do so with the following command:

	ln -s wish8.0 wish	
	
NOTE: You will need root access to do this. The other option is to change the first line in the 
tknotepad script FROM: 

	#!/usr/local/bin/wish -f

TO:

	#!/usr/local/bin/wish8.0 -f

this is assuming that you have version 8.0 of wish, if you have another version then instead of  
wish8.0 put wishx.x where x.x is the version number of Tk that you have.

5) To run make sure you are running X-windows then in an xterm type tknotepad &


Installing Under Windows 95/98/NT etc 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Winzip should have been used to extract this and it should have created a directory. This program now comes 
with a batch script to run under Windows 95/98/NT, called tknote.bat. The batch script has one line, shown below.

	"C:\Program Files\Tcl\bin\wish80" tknotepad

Edit the path to point to the location of your version of wish (in this case wish8.0). Then run the script. 
tknote.bat startup script.
